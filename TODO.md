# Planned Features

- [ ] Implement smoothing in MIDI note prioritization to allow for cleaner outputs
- [ ] Allow outputting precise peaks in real time (using an algorithm similar to one used to generate MIDI notes) via OSC
	- [ ] Allow normalizing output values using automatic ranging, using the same algorithm used in the UI
